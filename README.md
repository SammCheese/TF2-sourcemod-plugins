      > "!kamikaze true" Revives the RED team, changes them to Demoman and gives them a Caber which kills the User on Hit.
   
      > Damage done to Enemies uses Damagescaling (FF2BossHealth\*FF2BossLives/PlayersOnRED), although can be changed to use Attributes if specific lines are Commented/Uncommented
